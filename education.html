I personally think that something is wrong with our system of education. We send our children to school to prepare them for the real world that is changing very fast. But our schools haven't changed much for hundreds of years. In fact, thought leaders from around the world agree that the current system of education was designed in the Industrial Age mainly to churn out factory workers and this Industrial Age mentality of mass production and mass control still runs deep in schools. Unfortunately, we have no measure for how much talent, how much potential goes unrecognized in the current educational system. Having myself experienced difficulties finding my own magic formula for learning, I made myself a promise to share my experience with young people so that they gain confidence and succeed in their own way.

<a href="" target="_blank">Cheng Chi (Bill)</a> &ldquo;I want to thank Professor Lee and Mr. Amine Mohamed Aboussalah for providing and supporting me in this great research project during this summer. It enhances my academic ability and gives me the chance to use quantum physics on optimization problem, which is a hybrid of what I like and what I learned in school. So thanks again. This summer is a great learning experience for me. Professor Lee is kind and patient to us. Amine was friendly, easy-going and an illuminating leader. During our meeting, he will always inspire new ideas out of me and helped me understand the subject better. Plus, his background in physics is amazing and we share huge common interest on physics. Moreover, he is also a fan of football club Barcelona and likes playing soccer, which is same to me. It’s like finding a friend through learning. In a short word, this summer is fruitful.&rdquo;

<a href="" target="_blank">Xuan Ze Li (Charlie)</a> &ldquo;Finally, I would like to give a huge thank you to my other supevior, also my co-worker on this project, Amine Mohamed Aboussalah, who is a PhD candidate working in the DORL Research Group with Professor Lee. Tolerating my ignorance and himself under an extremely intense daily working schedule, he took countless hours out of his time explaining concepts to me, defining goals for each step of our project, providing essential feedback on my work and guiding me on our next steps. Besides, he is also a great friend who is constantly supporting me during my summer learning process. It is my best luck and a great honour to have him as my supervisor in my first research experience and therefore I want to thank him ​more than 3000​ for all he has done for me.&rdquo;

<a href="" target="_blank">Ling Jin</a> &ldquo;Huge Thanks to my supervisor Amine Aboussalah, who is so thoughtful on selecting research topics in the first place. I started my university life in engineering science with a strong target in going into financial engineering. It is so exciting and gratifying to work on the project which is directly relating to the field. I am so thankful for my supervisor who provided me this precious experience to learn about finance. I would never encounter and be part of this experience this easy without my supervisor. Also huge thanks for him always being thoughtful and patiently supporting and leading me through the four months. I would never be able to obtain what I have in the end without his support.&rdquo;

<a href="" target="_blank">Luke Volpatti</a> &ldquo;We would also like to thank Amine Aboussalah, who is a PhD student under the supervision of Professor Lee, for his invaluable guidance and support throughout the year. He took countless hours out of his time to explain concepts to us, make us aware of interesting new research avenues, and provide feedback on our work. We feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to work with Amine and thank him dearly for all he has done for us.&rdquo;
